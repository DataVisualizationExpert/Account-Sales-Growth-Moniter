# Project: Account Sales Growth Analysis  

## This project analyzes 5 years of sales data for various accounts, including wholesale distributors, online retailers, small businesses and medium businesses. The data includes sales figures by marketing channel, such as social media, coupons, catalogues, posters and more.   

## Created using Excel formulas, pivot tables, charts and graphs.

## Key Features:

• Calculates the 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each account by marketing channel.

• Determines the average CAGR by city, showing which cities had the highest and lowest sales growth.

• Visualizes year-over-year sales figures and CAGR for each account through charts and graphs.

## Key Highlights:

• Analyzed 5 years of account sales data from multiple business segments.

• Calculated CAGR by marketing channel to identify growth drivers and opportunities.

• Presented year-over-year sales and growth trends visually through Excel charts.

• Generated insights to improve account performance and accelerate sales growth.

The insights generated help identify which accounts, cities and marketing channels are driving the most growth and where there are opportunities for improvement.

This project was created during my internship with JP Morgan Chase as part of their Microsoft Excel internship program in 2023. The skills and knowledge gained in Excel data analysis, visualization and reporting were highly valuable for my studies and future career.

### In addition to the Excel files, I created a 5-slide PowerPoint presentation to showcase the key findings and recommendations from the analysis:

• Summary of accounts, period and data analyzed.

• Charts showing CAGR by marketing channel and by city.

• Tables with year-over-year sales and growth for high-performing and underperforming accounts.

• Recommendations to improve performance for underperforming accounts and marketing channels.

• Overall conclusions and next steps
